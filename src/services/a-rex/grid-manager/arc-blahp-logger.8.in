A-REX job identifier
.IP "\fB-U\fR \fIuser\fR"

.IP "\fB-P\fR \fIuser proxy\fR"
path to user proxy certificate file to get VOMS membership info
.IP "\fB-L\fR \fIjob status file\fR"
A-REX jobstatus .local file containint more info about job (like LRMS id)
.IP "\fB-c\fR \fIceid prefix\fR"
prefix to generate CE ID in accordance to GLUE1.3 publishing
.IP "\fB-p\fR \fIlog prefix\fR"
logs location and filename prefix. Default is \fB/var/log/arc/accounting/blahp.log\fR
.IP "\fB-d\fR \fIloglevel\fR"

.SH ENABLING PLUGIN IN A-REX CONFIGURATION

You need to add BLAH logger plugin as a handler for FINISHED state, e.g.:

.B authplugin="FINISHED timeout=10,onfailure=pass /usr/libexec/arc/arc-blahp-logger -I %I -U %u -L %C/job.%I.local -P %C/job.%I.proxy"

.SH CONFIGURATION

There are no particular plugin configuration except passing correct options.

By default BLAH log is written to
.B /var/log/arc/accounting/blahp.log-YYYYMMDD.
The log prefix (without \fB-YYYYMMDD\fR) can be redefined with optional \fB-p\fR option.

CE ID is generated automatically and has a format
.B host.fqdn:2811/nordugrid-torque-queue
in accordance to GLUE1.3 publishing.
Queue is added in runtime anyway, but prefix can be redefined with \fB-c\fR option.
This option should be added in case of LRMS.

To debug logger execution you can add \fB-d 5\fR option and see all ARC logger output from all subsystems used.
