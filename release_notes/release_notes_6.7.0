Advanced Resource Connector (ARC)
=================================


Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC  6.7.0     02.07.2020
------------------------------------------------------


Highlights in this release
--------------------------
This release comes with a handful of nice smaller enhancements and bugfixes.

Ubuntu deployment issues recently discovered are now fixed (Bugzilla 3933), and
We have added the possibility of read-only caches (Bugzilla 3924).

The useful arcctl tool has been extended with datastaging information functionality.
A first implementation is now released, and more additions are expected in coming releases. (Bugzilla 3906)

For ARC stability, several improvements have been made to avoid unexpected errors related
to datadelivery causing ARC crashes. The crashes have only been seen in the emi-es interface. (Bugzilla 3925)


Note about Centos8 and openldap server
---------------------------------------
In Centos8 the openldap	server is not installable because slapd	is not available in the RHEL8 release (Bugzilla 3944).
As a consequence, the LDAP-based server-side information system interface of the ARC-CE will not be available either.
If interaction with the ARC-CE relies on LDAP-based information schemas (glue1.3 or nordugrid schema),
then we recommend that you stay with Centos7 for the time being.

We expect to provide a workaround for future releases.



The following Bugzilla tickets have been adressed or solved
------------------------------------------------------------
* 3938  Implement the same definition of failed jobs as in gangliarc
* 3935  Request: Arcctl jobs kill/killall must actually kill jobs
* 3934  redirect stdout to stderr in script submit-condor-jobs
* 3933  arched-start incorrectly uses return instead of exit
* 3925  AREX crash
* 3924  Provide a read-only option for a cache
* 3923  Default infoprovider log level should be INFO
* 3922  job submission failed with sessiondir=*
* 3912  arcproxy -i should return non-zero exit code in case of error
* 3906  Addition to arcctl - make a summary of DTR information
* 3902  Job reported finished, but missing exit code and proper cpu and walltime
* 2058  support for the input staging jobs

Documentation

The ARC 6 documentation can be found at http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6

Installing ARC 6 
=================
We recommend to install ARC release using the Nordugrid repository.
* Start with the basics: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/try_arc6.html
* Get production ready: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/arc6_install_guide.html 

Note that if you instead install from EPEL for RHEL 7 compatible systems,
the ARC 6 packages can be found as nordugrid-arc6-* and not nordugrid-arc-*
This was needed in order to supply both ARC 5 already available for RHEL7 and the new ARC 6.


We provide binary builds for all supported versions of
  * Debian (i386 and amd64)
  * Fedora (i386 and x86_64) - from Fedora 26 - no i386 support
  * CentOS EL6 (i386 and x86_64) and EL7/EL8 (x86_64) - from EL7 no i386 support
  * Ubuntu (i386 and amd64, both LTS and interim releases) - from Ubuntu 20.40 no i386 support

In addition we build nightly packages for older platforms. 

Future support of ARC 5-series
===============================
As of June 2020 no more security updates are provided to ARC 5.
Also since the release of ARC 6 in June 2019, no more development on the ARC 5 code base has been provided.

Production Sites already running ARC 5 will still get operational site support in form of
deployment and configuration troubleshooting help via GGUS until end June 2021.
However, we may recommend upgrading to ARC 6 depending on the issues the site is facing. 

ARC5 is available in EPEL7 and will stay there. EPEL8 will only contain ARC 6.
To install ARC 6 from EPEL7 the package-names are of type: nordugrid-arc6-*
