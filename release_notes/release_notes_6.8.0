Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC  6.8.0     07.10.2020
------------------------------------------------------

We are pleased to announce the release of ARC 6.8.0.

The largest change in this release is the removal of the pre 6.4.0 accounting system.
Since the accounting subsystem changes in 6.4.0 where we went from files to database,
the old system has lived alongside the new. From 6.8.0 the legacy code is all removed.
For more details of the consequences, and especially changes in arc.conf,
please see: http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/jura-ng.html

Highlights in this release
--------------------------
* Removal of the pre 6.4.1 accounting sub-system. 
* Up until now the central datastaging.log file on the ARC-CE had a mix-up of the DTR-id's.
  This is now fixed in Bugzilla 3874.
* A benchmark option has been added to the lrms block to mitigate problems with missing benchmarks
  in the accounting, see details in http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/jura-ng.html.
* APEL summary query speed up - issues with overloading frontend when updating from pre 6.4.1
  to post 6.4.1 accounting system should now not occur. (Bugzilla 3893). 

Important note on xrootd version for sites using the nordugrid-arc-plugins-xrootd package
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For sites who install the nordugrid-arc-plugins-xrootd package note that ARC 6.8.0 is built with xrootd 5.
On the date of the release xrootd 5 has not yet reached EPEL-stable which means that to install(update) ARC 6.8.0 on RHEL-systems,
you must enable the epel-testing repo: 
yum install(update) "nordugrid-arc*" --enablerepo=epel-testing
or alternatively install xrootd 5 before updating ARC.

Documentation
==============
The ARC 6 documentation can be found at http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6

If you miss something or have questions, please contact us!


Installing ARC 6 
=================
We recommend to install ARC release using the Nordugrid repository.
* Start with the basics: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/try_arc6.html
* Get production ready: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/arc6_install_guide.html 

Note that if you instead install from EPEL for RHEL 7 compatible systems,
the ARC 6 packages can be found as nordugrid-arc6-* and not nordugrid-arc-*
This was needed in order to supply both ARC 5 already available for RHEL7 and the new ARC 6.


We provide binary builds for all supported versions of
  * Debian (i386 and amd64)
  * Fedora (i386 and x86_64) - from Fedora 26 - no i386 support
  * CentOS EL6 (i386 and x86_64) and EL7/EL8 (x86_64) - from EL7 no i386 support
  * Ubuntu (i386 and amd64, both LTS and interim releases) - from Ubuntu 20.04 no i386 support

In addition we build nightly packages for older platforms. 

Future support of ARC 5-series
===============================
As of June 2020 no more security updates are provided to ARC 5.
Also since the release of ARC 6 in June 2019, no more development on the ARC 5 code base has been provided.

Production Sites already running ARC 5 will still get operational site support in form of
deployment and configuration troubleshooting help via GGUS until end June 2021.
However, we may recommend upgrading to ARC 6 depending on the issues the site is facing. 

ARC5 is available in EPEL7 and will stay there. EPEL8 will only contain ARC 6.
To install ARC 6 from EPEL7 the package-names are of type: nordugrid-arc6-* 


Getting in touch
==================
If you need help with the configuration file or have any other questions related to ARC 6, please contact us via
* Email: nordugrid-discuss@nordugrid.org or wlcg-arc-ce-discuss@cern.ch
* Skype channel dedicated to ARC 6 support: https://join.skype.com/dyf3A6Uutjy2


Known issues
==============
* In Centos8 the openldap server is not installable because slapd is not available in the RHEL8 release (Bugzilla 3944).
  As a consequence, the LDAP-based server-side information system interface of the ARC-CE will not be available either.
  If interaction with the ARC-CE relies on LDAP-based information schemas (glue1.3 or nordugrid schema),
  then we recommend that you stay with Centos7 for the time being.
* Related to the new accounting system introduded in release 6.4.0: 
** Accounting records created by ARC 6.4.0 are affected by a bug causing missing benchmark values:
   https://bugzilla.nordugrid.org./show_bug.cgi?id=3921#c3
   Recommendations are to update to a newer version of ARC.
   The bugreport gives instructions on how to manually fix the wrong benchmark values.
